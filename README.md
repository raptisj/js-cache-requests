# JS Cache Requests

_WIP_

This repo is for learning purposes so I can explore different ways to cache data coming from an API.

Below you will find the respective branch for each approach.

Explore with:
- Cache API
- IndexedDB
- localStorage(although this is not the most optimal approach compared to the previous two)
