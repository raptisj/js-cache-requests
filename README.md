# JS Cache Requests

_WIP_

This repo is for learning purposes so I can explore different ways to cache data coming from an API.

Below you will find the respective branch for each approach.

Explore with:
- [Cache API](https://github.com/raptisj/js-cache-requests/tree/cache-api)
- [IndexedDB](https://github.com/raptisj/js-cache-requests/tree/indexedDB)
- [localStorage](https://github.com/raptisj/js-cache-requests/tree/local-storage)(although this is not the most optimal approach compared to the previous two)
