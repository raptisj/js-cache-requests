# JS Cache Requests

This repo is for learning purposes so I can explore different ways to cache data coming from an API.

Below you will find the respective branch for each approach.

Explore with:

- [IndexedDB](https://github.com/raptisj/js-cache-requests/tree/indexedDB)
- **localStorage**(you are here!)
